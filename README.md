My take on the course given on http://www.nand2tetris.org

The aim is building a functional computer system, starting from a NAND-gate and DFF (data-flipflop). 


06-12 are done in badly written Ruby 
(this was to make it a bit more difficult for me, since i don't know Ruby at all and it seemed like a good way to learn the language)
